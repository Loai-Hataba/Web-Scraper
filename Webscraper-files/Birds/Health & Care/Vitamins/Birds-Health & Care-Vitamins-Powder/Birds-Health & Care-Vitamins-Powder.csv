FEEDING GUIDELINES:PREPARATION:

we recommend you have the following items: a clean, sanitized mixing bowl for blending the hand-feeding powder with water, a heat source such as a brooder to keep baby birds warm after feeding, plastic feeding syringe(s) for delivery of the prepared, thermometer for measuring water and mixed formula temperature, paper towels, and a food safe disinfectant.

FEEDING:

easy to prepare and feed, but there are a few important steps to follow when preparing the formula.
We recommend using filtered water that has been heated to 120°F (49°C).
If unsure of the water quality, boil for a minimum of 10 minutes, and then allow the water to cool to 120°F before mixing with the hand feeding.
We do not recommend using a microwave to heat the water or mixed formula as microwave heating can cause uneven heating and dangerous hot spots.

NEWLY HATCHED TO 2-DAY (24 - 48 hrs) OLD CHICKS:

Should be fed a “watered-down” version of the formula. The formula will separate at this ratio, which is a normal occurrence. Blend well prior to each filling of the syringe to ensure adequate delivery of nutrients. A newborn chick requires hydration and water-soluble nutrients more than anything else at this early stage.

2 TO 5 DAY OLD CHICKS:

Begin to eat a thicker formula at a ratio of 1 part to 3 - 4 parts water. The blended formula should have the consistency of baby food or apple sauce but flows easily from the syringe or pipette.

5 DAYS OLD TO THE WEANING STAGE::

Should be mixed at an even thicker ratio and blended to the consistency of a creamy pudding. The ratios listed are our recommendations as a starting point. Humidity, ambient temperature, species of bird, etc. may require slight modifications.

OTHER IMPORTANT FEEDING GUIDELINES:

Baby birds need to be fed on a routine schedule.
Newly hatched baby birds need to be fed every 2 hours.
Their crops should empty or almost empty at this frequency. This will indicate if the baby bird is getting the right amount of food in between feedings
As your baby bird grows, its feeding frequency will decrease from every 2 hours and lengthen slowly to every 6 to 8 hours, depending on age, sex, and environmental temperature.",Higgins,45.0,//aleef.com/cdn/shop/files/HigginsinTuneHandFeedBabyBirds.jpg?v=1690801330
