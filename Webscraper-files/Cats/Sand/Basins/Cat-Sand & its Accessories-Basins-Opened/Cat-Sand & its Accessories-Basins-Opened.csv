Litter Tray With paws Strainer is a fun and functional product that adds a touch of cuteness to your cat’s litter box.
It works similarly to Litter Tray With Strainer, but with a twist: the strainer tray has paw-shaped holes that let the clean litter pass through, while the solid waste and clumps stay on top.
The non-strainer tray collects the clean litter and can be used as a replacement for the strainer tray.
It prevents tracking and scattering, as the clean litter stays in the tray and does not stick to your cat’s paws or fur.
Litter Tray With Paws Strainer is made of durable plastic that is easy to wash and sanitize.
It comes in different colours and sizes to suit your preference and your cat’s needs.
Litter Tray With Paws Strainer is a cute and clever solution for cat owners who want to make litter cleaning more enjoyable and less messy.
