Kit Cat Litter Locker Mat is a double-layered cat litter trap with a honeycomb weave that helps to trap litter from your cats’ paws after using the litter box
Designed to reduce the mess around your cat litter box, Kit Cat Litter Locker Mat is durable & lightweight, making it less of a burden when cleaning up after your cat.
Kit Cat Litter Locker Mat has two layers (unlike most litter mats) like a pouch to prevent tracked cat litter from moving around excessively or falling out of the litter mat.
Made of a soft, non-toxic (thermoplastic elastomer) material, Kit Cat Litter Locker Mat is gentle and soft on your cat’s paws, making it comfortable for your cat to step on.
Kit Cat Litter Locker Mat is also waterproof and very easy to clean, just shake the trapped litter out of the mat back into the litter box, & spray it with water.
Cutely shaped like the silhouette of a cat’s face, Kit Cat Litter Locker Mat can be placed anywhere in your home without disturbing the main theme of your cosy home!
