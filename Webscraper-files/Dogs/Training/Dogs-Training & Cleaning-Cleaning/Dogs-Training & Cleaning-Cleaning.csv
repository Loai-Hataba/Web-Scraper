This no-brush solution is specially formulated for dogs and cats, and uses advanced enzymes to combat plaque, bacteria and tartar, preventing tooth decay and dental disease.
Toothgel contains two enzymes that fight bacteria and break down plaque, helping to reduce bad breath.
Protease destroys the protein structure of plaque before it binds with calcium to create tartar
Glucose oxidase breaks glucose down into gluconic acid
This is harmless and produces a small amount of hydrogen peroxide, which provides an antibacterial action and kills the bacteria responsible for bad breath.
It also improves your pet’s breath and makes their teeth sparkle.
All you need to do is apply a thin line of gel on your pet’s teeth daily or a few times a week.
No need to brush or rinse!
Your pet will enjoy the yummy liver flavor and you will enjoy the peace of mind.
Beaphar Tooth Gel is fluoride-free, safe and suitable for all breeds of dogs and cats.
The gel comes in a 100g bottle with a long nozzle for easy application
Suitable for cats and dogs.

Ingredients: 

Protease, Glucose oxidase, Sodium tripolyphosphate, Zinc

Instructions:

ALWAYS FULLY READ THE PRODUCT LABEL AND PACKAGING BEFORE USE.
When using the gel for the first time, remove the foil from the top of the bottle and place the nozzle onto the opening of the tube.
Apply a thin line of Beaphar Tooth Gel across all of the teeth working from back to front. Do not worry if a spot gets missed as your pet will circulate the gel over their teeth with their tongue.
For maximum improvement it is recommended to reapply to your pet’s teeth daily, but two to three times a week will make an improvement to your pet's oral health.
