3,Zoo Med ReptiTherm Under Tank Heater,"Zoo Med ReptiTherm Under Tank Heater


An ideal 24-hour primary or secondary heat source for tropical or temperate reptilian species. 
All of Zoo Med’s Under Tank Heaters are UL/cUL approved (GS/TuV/CE in Europe) and contain a solid-state nichrome heating element. 
These under-tank heaters permanently adhere to your terrarium, forming a solid bond for optimum heat transfer.

Features:

Uses a solid-state nichrome heating element which uses only 16 watts of electricity and costs
Much less to operate than overhead heat bulbs. 

Instructions: ""Watch The Video""

Off the back of the heater and ""stick"" to the bottom underside of your terrarium. 
We recommend you place the heater on either the right or left side of the terrarium and gently rub the heater to make firm contact with the bottom glass. 
This allows one side of your terrarium to be warmer than the other side thus giving your animals a natural temperature variance.

Helpful Hints: 

Should your terrarium be in particularly cold areas you may need to add an additional Repti Therm UH.

11,Flamingo Heating Mat 7 watt,"Flamingo heating cable 7watt

Self-adhesive heating mat for glass terraria. 
It helps to keep your pet's temperature constant. 
The increased temperature stimulates the appetite, digestion, metabolism and the pet's normal behaviour. 
In the event of sickness, this mat can help in recovery. 
As only a part of the terrarium is covered with the heating mat, the temperature is higher at one end than at the other. This creates a natural temperature progression for the animals. 
Not suitable for plastic wooden terraria. 
It can be used in combination with a thermostat. 
Very easy to install against the outside of the terrarium glass.
